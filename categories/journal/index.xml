      <description>I love the mountains here because there are always dense collections of wildflowers under the tree line: purple buds sitting in crevices and yellow petals caressing their grassy neighbors. In places their beauty rivals the alps, the colorful fields an undeniable testimony to the power of nature undisturbed and to the charm of small wonders. They sway in the wind with a carefree attitude of the unbothered and unnamed, some immortalized and dried out by the sun.</description>

      <description>Mi Pequeno San Juan by Nico Thomassin: I first saw this painting in a gallery in Puerto Rico and it forever will capture my feeling of awe to witness a whole city glow at night  I’m laughing and cradling my knees while the moon rises over a sun that has not yet said goodbye. It is an impossibly charming outlook of the entire city of Zürich from this rooftop that somehow is just taller than its neighbors but I still find myself looking forward to the ample clouds that pass by to cover the roundness of the moonlight.</description>

      <description>january 2022 - february 2022
I think about this quote (outside of any context) a lot1.
 “Have you, dear reader, ever tried writing poetry that will set the collective soul of your nation on fire? If no, why not?”

Lately it’s been hard to think - running from city to city and studio to classroom - I’m forgetting to feel the snow crunch beneath my feet and to take my mask off to smell the fresh air.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;take note of the things that touch your heart, then you will know what you like&amp;rdquo; - Blue Period
 1-21-22
I’m sitting on a plane to LA - in a liminal space within a larger liminal time. On the precipice of a new destination, but not quite there yet. Traveling. Questioning. The past two months were ones of reflection and searching for the things that touch my heart.</description>
