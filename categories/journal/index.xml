      <description>&lt;div&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://axguo.github.io/images/posts/swiss_mountain.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;view of the swiss mountains&#34; style=&#34;width: 60%;&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/div&gt; &#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love the mountains here because there are always dense collections of wildflowers under the tree line: purple buds sitting in crevices and yellow petals caressing their grassy neighbors. In places their beauty rivals the alps, the colorful fields an undeniable testimony to the power of nature undisturbed and to the charm of small wonders. They sway in the wind with a carefree attitude of the unbothered and unnamed, some immortalized and dried out by the sun. A few are now resting pressed in my notebook. I try to search for their names. I can’t find any—in another life, one not so forgiving, they would have been known as weeds. White puffballs are the most abundant amongst these mountainside stems, holding globes of dandelion seeds resting half undressed. Dandelions were once celebrated in magic and medicine. Now they’re relentlessly eradicated from lawns and city grass.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>conversations in the dark</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://axguo.github.io/images/posts/nico.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;painting of a colorful city of lights on a hill at night&#34; style=&#34;width: 49%;&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;img-caption&#34; style=&#34;width: 49%;&#34;&gt;Mi Pequeno San Juan by Nico Thomassin: I first saw this painting in a gallery in Puerto Rico and it forever will capture my feeling of awe to witness a whole city glow at night&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt; &#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m laughing and cradling my knees while the moon rises over a sun that has not yet said goodbye. It is an impossibly charming outlook of the entire city of Zürich from this rooftop that somehow is just taller than its neighbors but I still find myself looking forward to the ample clouds that pass by to cover the roundness of the moonlight. Because in the dark, I stop caring about most things. I can feel my face relax, free to move into configurations that no one will see, unburdened by the weight of a smile that always lasts too long. My body reacts in ways unchecked with loose chuckles and shifts of surprise. No one can see me, or so I’d like to believe. What exists in the dark is only the floating voices and a heightened perception of how I feel, and in this moment I am happy. Happy to feel so comfortable sitting around cold pizza with new friends on top of a whole city and happy that silent pauses feel less heavy in the dark. I could close my eyes and hear the exclamations around me and pick out each unique laugh. The absence of light is a blessing for someone who sometimes overthinks, attuned to the minuscule shifts in another’s demeanor. It’s no wonder that some of my favorite conversations have happened at night: lying on the pier under the stars and spilling out our heartaches, jokes on a dark park bench, or conversations like this, where daylight faded and we decided to stay. I think it’s the same reason why I prefer phone calls to video chat: when everything else is stripped away except voice, we fill up the space in a raw, unfiltered way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>finding the right words</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;january 2022 - february 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think about this quote (outside of any context) a lot&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Have you, dear reader, ever tried writing poetry that will set the collective soul of your nation on fire? If no, why not?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3-1-22&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Lately it’s been hard to think - running from city to city and studio to classroom - I’m forgetting to feel the snow crunch beneath my feet and to take my mask off to smell the fresh air. I traveled to LA and spent a week in the woods near Yosemite before being whisked straight into my last undergraduate semester. The peace I found amongst the trees was hard to keep back in the city but the difference I found this time is most of what I am doing brings me great joy - I never thought I’d have to protect my time from myself, to make sure to take breaks from the activities I love to sit with myself and reflect. What has helped is disrupting my routine with reading, and surprisingly writing: something I said I would do for all of 2021 without forming a single sentence, a goal now manifested in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>entering a liminal space</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;december 2021 - january 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;take note of the things that touch your heart, then you will know what you like&amp;rdquo; - Blue Period&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1-21-22&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I’m sitting on a plane to LA - in a liminal space within a larger liminal time. On the precipice of a new destination, but not quite there yet. Traveling. Questioning. The past two months were ones of reflection and searching for the things that touch my heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
