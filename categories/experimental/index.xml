      <title>what if writing was...</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-map&#34;&gt;a map &lt;a href=&#34;#a-map&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin with intentions is terribly important — by setting intentions for my writing, I see myself as marking the landscapes and the boundaries of the territory that I am embarking into. To set my intentions is to attempt to create the map of my mind as I know it now — undoubtedly incomplete and fated to be rearranged and re-rearranged, but it will be a starting point because no one begins with a blank map. We all have copied bits and pieces from others, imitating and making up geographies from everyone we have ever met or read. The making of my map consists of conversations under late night kitchen lights describing the contours of a road that resembles friendship and opinions passed around through so many mouths that I wonder if the shape of the conclusion I have received on some political matter that I know nothing about even resembles the original. It feels like playing a long game of picture telephone, passing pieces of drawings around to be mimicked where the entire world is participating and the end result is something horrifically, comically inaccurate and distorted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Memory&amp;rsquo;s images, once they are fixed in words, are erased&amp;quot; - Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;i&#34;&gt;I. &lt;a href=&#34;#i&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6 parts titanium white, 3 parts phthalo blue, 1 part ultramarine blue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;a hint of napthol red and ochre yellow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;a sky that bleeds saying goodbye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;to a sun too quickly burning away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Walnuts can break a man, or at least they broke me. What other nut can be sold encased in an indestructible shell, cutting the hands of an eight year old determined to prove her strength? What need does a bitter and oily nut have to be so guarded, only to be spat and not swallowed by a girl determined to memorize the folds that make it distinct from a pecan so that she may learn who to avoid. In a steady machine, the outer hull is rotated while slashed until metal bristles rub off the first layer, before moving to cracking the shells. A naked walnut can be sold as is, or pressed and crushed and pressed again into a paste. An oil is then freed. The startling flavor created from a violent process makes it perfect for drizzling over salads or complimenting desserts. The pale richness also makes it a prime candidate for a medium to smooth out oil paints.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Dine Alone</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You try to catch the waiter’s attention, but his focus skips over to the young couple by the window. They have just sat down, but there is twice the body to catch the eye — twice the hunger, twice the urgency. You give a small wave as he passes by, not enough for a friend, barely enough for the stranger. There is no need to be extravagant, no one is watching — movement from a still corner will always elicit surprise. There is not much room for back and forth, dishes are not to be shared. No commitment issues, the item you choose is what you’ll get. It all happens very fast -  silent conversations always pass the quickest. You are decisive, you have decided to be a party of one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
