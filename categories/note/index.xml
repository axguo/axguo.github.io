      <description>A friend once told me that there must be something special about human faces that makes them so hard to draw ‚Äî a certain elusive quality that comes from the ineffable experience of being human. This took me by surprise because I live with an extremely strong belief that it only takes practice, and relatively little at that, to obtain the skills necessary to draw a reasonable human face. It‚Äôs true that most attempts at facial features are awful, more resembling elongated emojis than facial features but I think that‚Äôs only because we take our faces for granted.</description>

      <description>Something wonderful has changed here. I feel so full of ideas, sending out pitches instead of finished work. Today I reached out to strangers (non-coders) asking if they wanted to collaborate on unspecified projects without knowing if I‚Äôd be able to help bring us to reach a shared vision. I felt giddy and sophisticated, like an artist about to graduate from faking it to making it.
A year ago I would have balked at the thought of offering to create something seemingly magical and impossible without a hint of a plan.</description>

      <description>from life to me to you :)
 1-29-23  Unconference. Next time I will run a session/conversation.   1-28-23  Have you ever held an idea in your mind and tried to write it without words? I&amp;rsquo;m going further off the abstract deep end with asemic writing.   1-25-23  I NOW HAVE A VINTAGE CORONA FOUR TYPEWRITER. To feel the physicality of my typing like this is incredible.</description>

      <description>noticing  touch things - the leaves on the bush or the wall of the old building and really feel the interaction take a walk down the street without earbuds and try to notice as many sounds as possible, there is a whole orchestra in traffic food meditations - appreciation for the flavors and textures before devouring live life as the main character in a Studio Ghibli movie - romanticize the little things and see the wind dance joyfully through the grass go on a walk - romanticize the little things, see myself as a studio ghibli movie people watch or listen - eavesdropping by a better name.</description>

      <description>Quick questions jotted down as part of our cabin retreat planning activities. What are currently some fundamental questions in your life?
 how can art move a life? what is the value of attention and observation? how can we be good witnesses? what does it mean to create something? is there a way to increase serendipitous happenings? what can we learn from others? what must we experience for ourselves? what objects and ideas are our identities tethered to?</description>
