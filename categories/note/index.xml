      <description>from life to me to you :)
 12-27-22  When it&amp;rsquo;s cold in Texas all of the shrubs get blankets.   12-25-22  Being released from quarantine for the holidays is a blessing. I am so grateful for the mundane. Of being able to eat meals with my parents and coexist in the same spaces.   4-19-22  Orchid mantis! A mantis that looks like an orchid! They exist!</description>

      <description>noticing  touch things - the leaves on the bush or the wall of the old building and really feel the interaction take a walk down the street without earbuds and try to notice as many sounds as possible, there is a whole orchestra in traffic food meditations - appreciation for the flavors and textures before devouring live life as the main character in a Studio Ghibli movie - romanticize the little things and see the wind dance joyfully through the grass go on a walk - romanticize the little things, see myself as a studio ghibli movie people watch or listen - eavesdropping by a better name.</description>

      <description>Quick questions jotted down as part of our cabin retreat planning activities. What are currently some fundamental questions in your life?
 how can art move a life? what is the value of attention and observation? how can we be good witnesses? what does it mean to create something? is there a way to increase serendipitous happenings? what can we learn from others? what must we experience for ourselves? what objects and ideas are our identities tethered to?</description>
