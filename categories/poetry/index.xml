      <description>were not meant to be. I wish
to be lucky, enough
for the red I am wearing.
To be formless, genreless. Miscellaneous
always. To be willingly
categorized. I give you consent.
To be occasionally refreshing.
To be a factory of permissions.
To be a stronger vessel for my heart.
To be next.</description>

      <title>Thoughts from a dying mall</title>

      <description>Wake up today feeling the vulnerability of winter. Fall leaves falling, leaving me exposed like every year before. Cold air rushing in the change of seasons and time running out, running towards an arbitrary new year, running towards made up deadlines. The ground becomes too stiff to bury old pictures, so I hang onto them in pockets that won’t fit more than half a person. I see my wishes being stripped naked like the orange trees that line the streets in a direction picked with a roll of the dice.</description>

      <description>Crawling earthquakes are born of a thousand
whispered truths. Picking out crimson apricots,
bruising soft stones with my thumb.
Walking down stiff concrete streets
peeking around corners, wondering if a impish wind
has curved my words. If anyone can hear a daring
breath, humming lyrics never to be shared. I practice
singing in an empty parking lot—there is a dandelion
gathering his friends. I practice driving through
the same cracked road you first showed me.</description>

      <description>back to the building from three years ago
sneaking in to the rhythm of the concierge’s nods.
I keep finding myself in places I know too well,
an overexposed photo of blurred bodies yet
my face sits clearly where it has always been
near new students that have learned to carry
their name tags in their mouths. the pink touch-me-nots
beg to be saved from the coming winter so I pluck</description>

      <description>an irrational ratio
each hour spent at the park
parked outside the bookstore that
we never entered, spend an hour
on the phone, conveying a
secondhand kind of love to my
friend who hasn’t heard this
smile in my voice, it’s been so long
no body should ever be that warm
i might burn from the flutter of my legs
doing a silly dance, the audience gone
the performance is over but you are still here</description>

      <description>If I trust my head. Twisted
vines creep to an unreachable
sun but knowledge sits in roots
tangled, knotted in biased hugs.
Amber words dissolve in a salty
river where flames steal my bark
and flesh. I swing between birds,
or are they stationary fish? See
my body lost in glass ferns,
too fragile to free.
If I trust my heart. Violent
spirits shake yellow chrysanthemums
growing from my chest. Soft painted</description>

      <description>&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;
1: a branch of morphology that deals with the structure of organisms how to build a home
of identical red scaled roofs —
homeowner’s serpent
swallowing sounds
of mismatched bricks and cartoon walls covering
jelly beans spread on a child’s lap
how does she sort out the saccharine pebbles?
 sweet ribbon scarlet
of a blood that pumps in her heart but
my blood swirls gold and green with</description>

      <description>click slide clink slip push wooden chopsticks
chasing charred duck drowning in soy
click slide push slide slide the now flightless fowl
nested on a bed of scallion evades my
American grip with an uncomfortable liveliness
click squeeze slide push stab nothing like
the the delicate caress of my parent’s movements
swish glide pinch rub stir their chopsticks
a charming dance - I’m convinced they can do anything while
I give up and stab an already dead bird</description>

      <description>my dad&amp;rsquo;s hands gently coax shy dough balls he raised
into imperfect circles they stretch
glutinous strands
reaching to hug
the clockwise stir of my mom&amp;rsquo;s chopsticks
teaching her filling to bond
low-sodium over sister spices of scallion and ginger
massaging oil into a fragmented mix
I introduce wrapper and meat
binding two ancestors with a tender fold and screaming pinch
blood, not water, holds these dumplings
completing their plump embrace</description>
