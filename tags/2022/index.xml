      <description>from life to me to you :)
 1-29-23  Unconference. Next time I will run a session/conversation.   1-28-23  Have you ever held an idea in your mind and tried to write it without words? I&amp;rsquo;m going further off the abstract deep end with asemic writing.   1-25-23  I NOW HAVE A VINTAGE CORONA FOUR TYPEWRITER. To feel the physicality of my typing like this is incredible.</description>

      <description>january 2022 - february 2022
I think about this quote (outside of any context) a lot1.
 ‚ÄúHave you, dear reader, ever tried writing poetry that will set the collective soul of your nation on fire? If no, why not?‚Äù

Lately it‚Äôs been hard to think - running from city to city and studio to classroom - I‚Äôm forgetting to feel the snow crunch beneath my feet and to take my mask off to smell the fresh air.</description>

      <description>What I know to be true at 22, and possibly not at 23.
What I know changes with each of the lives that I live.
I think it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to do one of these every year :)
  What I know to be true is that attention and observation are what make life meaningful. I want to witness the world and the people in it. Attending to myself, to friends, to nature, to strangers has never been more pressing.</description>
