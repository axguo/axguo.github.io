      <description>&lt;p&gt;You try to catch the waiter’s attention, but his focus skips over to the young couple by the window. They have just sat down, but there is twice the body to catch the eye — twice the hunger, twice the urgency. You give a small wave as he passes by, not enough for a friend, barely enough for the stranger. There is no need to be extravagant, no one is watching — movement from a still corner will always elicit surprise. There is not much room for back and forth, dishes are not to be shared. No commitment issues, the item you choose is what you’ll get. It all happens very fast -  silent conversations always pass the quickest. You are decisive, you have decided to be a party of one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
