      <description>You try to catch the waiter’s attention, but his focus skips over to the young couple by the window. They have just sat down, but there is twice the body to catch the eye — twice the hunger, twice the urgency.

There is no need to be extravagant, no one is watching — movement from a still corner will always elicit surprise.</description>
