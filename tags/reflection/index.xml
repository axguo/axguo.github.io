      <description>#single {font-family: &#34;Spectral&#34;, serif; font-weight: 300; font-size: 1.2em;} The phrase I keep coming back to this year is ‚ú® world-expanding. ‚ú® It applies to experiences, cities, people, and even the sky. When I see someone do that crazy something/live in a way that I didn‚Äôt even know was possible, it feels like my world has expanded: the possibility space for living has just grown that much bigger. This was written as a letter to a small group of friends but I wanted to share.</description>

      <description>Check out the sketches :)
Some thoughts on a month(ish) of generative sketches. I hesitate to use the word ‚Äúgenerative‚Äù anymore because it‚Äôs been so overtaken by AI. What I mean here for my works are good old creative coding sketches, turtle graphics vibes and shaders. Pixels that have been handcrafted with care.   Pretty informal compared to my post last year and more of a collection of floating thoughts varying in importance to see if the challenge is worth doing again next year and in what capacity.</description>

      <description>a reflection on a month-ish of daily-ish sketches and the seeds that they nourished - check them out here ü§ó
    On what it means to continue creating art1:
 &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;it means leaving some loose thread, some unresolved issue, to carry forward and explore in the next piece&amp;hellip;it means always carrying within you the seed crystal for your next destination.&amp;rdquo;
  The First Seed Sometime around October, I participated with some friends in a coding cypher as part of¬†a collaboration between MIT and Lupe Fiasco where we had the creative freedom to create pretty much anything artistic from a very vague prompt.</description>

      <description>a loose weaving of thoughts on (my) art and where I find myself in the creative ecosystem
When asking myself why I create art, an incomplete but true answer would be because it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always done. In the moments that I am incapable of stringing together the right words, I turn to art. It‚Äôs how I find myself dealing with feelings - both those that I don‚Äôt want and those that I would like to preserve and hold close to take with me wherever I go.</description>

      <title>what I know to be true [22]</title>

      <description>What I know to be true at 22, and possibly not at 23.
What I know changes with each of the lives that I live.
I think it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to do one of these every year :)
  What I know to be true is that attention and observation are what make life meaningful. I want to witness the world and the people in it. Attending to myself, to friends, to nature, to strangers has never been more pressing.</description>
