      <description>“Memory&amp;rsquo;s images, once they are fixed in words, are erased&amp;quot; - Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities
 I. 6 parts titanium white, 3 parts phthalo blue, 1 part ultramarine blue
a hint of napthol red and ochre yellow
a sky that bleeds saying goodbye
to a sun too quickly burning away
Walnuts can break a man, or at least they broke me. What other nut can be sold encased in an indestructible shell, cutting the hands of an eight year old determined to prove her strength?</description>

      <description>You try to catch the waiter’s attention, but his focus skips over to the young couple by the window. They have just sat down, but there is twice the body to catch the eye — twice the hunger, twice the urgency. You give a small wave as he passes by, not enough for a friend, barely enough for the stranger. There is no need to be extravagant, no one is watching — movement from a still corner will always elicit surprise.</description>

      <description>a loose weaving of thoughts on (my) art and where I find myself in the creative ecosystem
When asking myself why I create art, an incomplete but true answer would be because it’s what I’ve always done. In the moments that I am incapable of stringing together the right words, I turn to art. It’s how I find myself dealing with feelings - both those that I don’t want and those that I would like to preserve and hold close to take with me wherever I go.</description>
