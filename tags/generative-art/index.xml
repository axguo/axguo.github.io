      <description>Check out the sketches :)
Some thoughts on a month(ish) of generative sketches. I hesitate to use the word ‚Äúgenerative‚Äù anymore because it‚Äôs been so overtaken by AI. What I mean here for my works are good old creative coding sketches, turtle graphics vibes and shaders. Pixels that have been handcrafted with care.   Pretty informal compared to my post last year and more of a collection of floating thoughts varying in importance to see if the challenge is worth doing again next year and in what capacity.</description>

  The First Seed Sometime around October, I participated with some friends in a coding cypher as part of¬†a collaboration between MIT and Lupe Fiasco where we had the creative freedom to create pretty much anything artistic from a very vague prompt.</description>
