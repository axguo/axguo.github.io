      <description>from life to me to you :)
 12-27-22  When it&amp;rsquo;s cold in Texas all of the shrubs get blankets.   12-25-22  Being released from quarantine for the holidays is a blessing. I am so grateful for the mundane. Of being able to eat meals with my parents and coexist in the same spaces.   4-19-22  Orchid mantis! A mantis that looks like an orchid! They exist!</description>
