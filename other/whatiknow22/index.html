      <p><em>What I know to be true at 22, and possibly not at 23.</em><br>
<em>What I know changes with each of the lives that I live.</em><br>
<em>I think it&rsquo;d be fun to do one of these every year :)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What I know to be true is that attention and observation are what make life meaningful. <strong>I want to witness the world and the people in it.</strong> Attending to myself, to friends, to nature, to strangers has never been more pressing. I have so many years left to spend with myself, and I’m excited to get to know her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Art, music, literature, are my nourishments. Sometimes they’re the most important things, with the power to move lives. That I know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know that food is and always will be important to me in how I take care of my body and soul. My identity is intertwined with the food I eat and make. It is how I can connect to my parents and my ancestry and to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What I put into life is what I will get back</strong>, something that I don’t feel like I’ve been doing too great with recently. I’m forgetting to appreciate the little things, which I know to be what bring me the most joy: <em>sunny walks, a good book, particularly rebellious flowers growing through fences.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not everything needs to be analyzed. Some things can just be felt. Words are not always the best medium for communication, though I have to admit there is an incredible power to being articulate and moving someone with your prose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know that I’m afraid of a lot of things - much more than I would like to admit. I’m afraid of failure, of judgment, of doing the wrong thing. I know that probably won’t change much and that many others feel the same and <strong>what I can do is to have courage moving forward despite these fears.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone should be able to do their own thing and just try not to burn things down. I know how I want to live my life and I don’t need to agree with my friends’ life views. Friendship is built on understanding and seeing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t have any grandiose hopes of changing the world right now, whatever that means. I want to change myself and bring joy to the people around me and do what I think is right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know like being alone, much more than the common era permits. Hermit phases come and go, but <strong>I know the value of being with myself and conversing with her and the trees.</strong> Some of the best conversations I’ve had.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I know that kindness and compassion exist in abundance.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
