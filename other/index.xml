      <description>Some words aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be edited, and this is where mine live.  permission to rage 4-27-22 I was given permission today
by a confession that slipped
from under a tongue so still
it had forgotten what it hid
until I sang with a choking sob
words scratching my esophagus
permission to rage
granted by a truth let out
bucket list 4-6-22 down sunny newbury street we’ll walk
you’ll point at the people and I’ll watch you talk</description>

      <description>What I know to be true at 22, and possibly not at 23.
What I know changes with each of the lives that I live.
I think it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to do one of these every year :)
  What I know to be true is that attention and observation are what make life meaningful. I want to witness the world and the people in it. Attending to myself, to friends, to nature, to strangers has never been more pressing.</description>
