<h4 id="_permission-to-rage_"><strong><em>permission to rage</em></strong> <a href="#_permission-to-rage_" class="anchor"></a></h4><h6 id="_4-27-22_"><em>4-27-22</em> <a href="#_4-27-22_" class="anchor"></a></h6><p>I was given permission today<br>
by a confession that slipped<br>
from under a tongue so still<br>
it had forgotten what it hid</p>
<p>until I sang with a choking sob<br>
words scratching my esophagus<br>
permission to rage<br>
granted by a truth let out</p>
<h4 id="_bucket-list_"><strong><em>bucket list</em></strong> <a href="#_bucket-list_" class="anchor"></a></h4><h6 id="_4-6-22_"><em>4-6-22</em> <a href="#_4-6-22_" class="anchor"></a></h6><p>down sunny newbury street we’ll walk<br>
you’ll point at the people and I’ll watch you talk<br>
budding magnolias and cherry blossoms stretch in the warmth<br>
there’s a difference between pink buds, you’ll learn<br>
bricked path singing to the steps of our shoes<br>
a symphony of feet for a melody of two<br>
we must go see the flowers one last time<br>
<em>they’ll remain for the rest of the month,</em><br>
<em>and a lifetime past mine</em></p>
<p>let’s go to the movies once again<br>
forgetting that we’ve never been<br>
can our hands meet in buttered popcorn?<br>
that’s what the movies always show - is it true I wouldn’t know<br>
there are so many firsts left for us<br>
what about lasts - are there more<br>
<em>who is this list really for</em></p>
<p>a restaurant, maybe, after a whole day’s break<br>
i’ll take a peck for a bite of cake<br>
play roulette with the menu and eat without eyes<br>
laugh so hard that I actually cry<br>
unbutton if we are to make it home<br>
collapse heavily in your living room</p>
<p>can we go to the beach just once more?<br>
play in water and sit on the shore<br>
feel the waves pull us away from our lives<br>
tumble and drown in a sea god’s cries<br>
another sunset over the foam<br>
<em>she’ll keep setting for years to come,</em><br>
<em>following oceans until she loses her shine</em><br>
<em>for a lifetime past mine</em></p>
<p>we must visit a museum, I say<br>
knowing that those dusty paintings won’t walk away<br>
those renaissance babies never age<br>
they’ll remain there for the rest of the day<br>
<em>what’s old will stay old for all of time</em><br>
<em>and all the lifetimes past mine</em></p>
<h4 id="_keeping-my-blue-at-bay_"><strong><em>keeping my blue at bay</em></strong> <a href="#_keeping-my-blue-at-bay_" class="anchor"></a></h4><h6 id="_1-16-21_"><em>1-16-21</em> <a href="#_1-16-21_" class="anchor"></a></h6><p>this plunking in my kitchen overtakes a winter rain<br>
I spend a meditative hour caressing, careful<br>
cutting cautiously to avoid spilling red<br>
yet I cannot hide the stickiness of<br>
unexpected casualties<br>
my fumbling hands too rough for that delicate skin<br>
picking off the punctured pieces, I nourish myself<br>
licking that sweet tangy nectar<br>
and continue crackling<br>
the crimson splatter<br>
keeping my blue at bay</p>

<h4 id="_story-of-my-life_"><em>story of my life</em> <a href="#_story-of-my-life_" class="anchor"></a></h4><h6 id="_12-4-21_"><em>12-4-21</em> <a href="#_12-4-21_" class="anchor"></a></h6><p><em>Do not listen to their little lies</em><br>
Gleaming, gleeful, self-obsessed<br>
They dance and weave through the crowded night<br>
Carelessly flirting before they part</p>
<p><em>Do not rely on their little lies</em><br>
Alone with sun is all you’ll be<br>
You’re a romantic this I know<br>
For who else could love a star<br>
<em>That only gives half his heart</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve always known that feelings never last<br>
I cling to dreams already gone<br>
Can I resurrect the ghosts I once knew?<br>
The familiar pressure flows<br>
I once thought that tears were how they knew<br>
It is time to remember and return<br>
Pitying the girl crying underneath the sink<br>
Loving her until the memories resurface<br>
She’s always known<br>
She always will<br>
<strong>But she’ll always forget</strong></p>

<h4 id="_sticky-notes_"><strong><em>sticky notes</em></strong> <a href="#_sticky-notes_" class="anchor"></a></h4><h6 id="_12-27-20_"><em>12-27-20</em> <a href="#_12-27-20_" class="anchor"></a></h6><p>My obsession with sticky notes is one that I can’t quite trace the origin of, but one that is incredibly core to what I consider to be my identity. I like lists, always have. There’s something comforting about a list - everything placed in permanent ink, unable to budge. A list will not change unless you so choose to. Sometimes the feeling of being put together is all but an illusion, but the feeling of control is so very real. By writing down my thoughts, goals, worries, I am able to wrangle the huge looming thread of sprawling thoughts into a few strokes of ink on paper. Much more manageable. I’m guaranteed never to truly lose anything when it’s recorded somewhere. Not that I’ll ever look at it again. That’s where the sticky notes came in I guess - modular list items in the huge list that is my life rendered as a collection of sticky notes. I’ll never lose anything, because I’m terrified of forgetting myself.</p>

<h4 id="_what-is-the-opposite-of-loneliness_"><strong><em>what is the opposite of loneliness</em></strong> <a href="#_what-is-the-opposite-of-loneliness_" class="anchor"></a></h4><h6 id="_6-10-20_"><em>6-10-20</em> <a href="#_6-10-20_" class="anchor"></a></h6><p>The immediate guess would be togetherness. Being around company, in the physical presence of other people, but some of the times I have felt the most alone were when I was surrounded by others.</p>
<p>I don’t feel lonely when I’m with my friends.
I have felt lonely when I’m with my friends.
I have felt lonely by myself.
I also don’t feel lonely by myself.</p>
<p>The opposite of loneliness is laughing so hard that I can’t breathe. It’s being passed out on the floor with like-bodied incapacitated friends. When I’m feeling grumpy after an unplanned nap and walk out my door and just feeling the presence of the people in my dorm soothes me. The opposite of loneliness isn’t tied to the physical world, it’s a feeling. It’s the feeling that everything will be okay no matter what because I am with the people I love the most in either body or spirit and feeling their presence around and in me all the time.</p>
<p>It’s a feeling that I’m so grateful to have. I can’t explain it. It’s warm hugs from thin air.</p>

<h4 id="_senses_"><strong><em>senses</em></strong> <a href="#_senses_" class="anchor"></a></h4><h6 id="5-12-20">5-12-20 <a href="#5-12-20" class="anchor"></a></h6><p>common sense no longer applies<br>
I have no experience<br>
from where to draw<br>
             　　　drawing the lines of your jaw<br>
to the lashes on your eyes<br>
      　　          those eyes<br>
that see what I couldn’t see<br>
                            　　　in myself<br>
                       I see you<br>
                            in me<br>
             and finally see<br>
                               me from you</p>
