      <description>&lt;style&gt;#single {font-family: &#34;Spectral&#34;, serif; font-weight: 300; font-size: 1.2em;}&lt;/style&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The phrase I keep coming back to this year is ✨ &lt;em&gt;world-expanding.&lt;/em&gt; ✨ It applies to experiences, cities, people, and even the sky. When I see someone do that crazy something/live in a way that I didn’t even know was possible, it feels like my world has expanded: the possibility space for living has just grown that much bigger. &#xA;&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;small class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;&#xA;    This was written as a letter to a small group of friends but I wanted to share.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;were not meant to be. I wish&lt;br&gt;&#xA;to be lucky, enough&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;for the red I am wearing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To be formless, genreless. Miscellaneous&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;always. To be willingly&lt;br&gt;&#xA;categorized. I give you consent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be occasionally refreshing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To be a factory of permissions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be a stronger vessel for my heart.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To be next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>reflections from a month(ish) of generative sketches</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aliciaguo.com/genuary2023/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sketches&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts on a month(ish) of generative sketches. &#xA;&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;small class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;&#xA;    I hesitate to use the word “generative” anymore because it’s been so overtaken by AI. What I mean here for my works are good old creative coding sketches, turtle graphics vibes and shaders. Pixels that have been handcrafted with care.&#xA;  &lt;/small&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA; Pretty informal compared to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aliciaguo.com/posts/dailysketch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;post last year&lt;/a&gt; and more of a collection of floating thoughts varying in importance to see if the challenge is worth doing again next year and in what capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts from a dying mall</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wake up today feeling the vulnerability of winter. Fall leaves falling, leaving me exposed like every year before. Cold air rushing in the change of seasons and time running out, running towards an arbitrary new year, running towards made up deadlines. The ground becomes too stiff to bury old pictures, so I hang onto them in pockets that won’t fit more than half a person. I see my wishes being stripped naked like the orange trees that line the streets in a direction picked with a roll of the dice. Follow the dots blindly walk through indiscriminate gales that threaten to question my loves until I reach a dried out beacon. Every town has one. Jewelry kiosks and outdated clothes. Panda Express and fortune cookies smell like safety, of childhood before seasons and summers playing chess and watching Goosebumps while the knights and rooks took their break. Can’t watch Goosebumps anymore, not since learning monsters are real. Fall has been breaking this place for far too long, stripping the dreams of a common space now crowded out by commercial suburbia.  This one’s third floor, closest to a ceiling wide skylight: already shut down, gates down. Second floor fighting to hold onto customers that never make it past the first. If this is trickle-down theory from heaven then hell might be the last safe place. Crack the cookie to read the slip of paper that falls out. That future has already passed:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crawling earthquakes are born of a thousand&lt;br&gt;&#xA;whispered truths. Picking out crimson apricots,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;bruising soft stones with my thumb.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Walking down stiff concrete streets&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;peeking around corners, wondering if a impish wind&lt;br&gt;&#xA;has curved my words. If anyone can hear a daring&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;breath, humming lyrics never to be shared. I practice&lt;br&gt;&#xA;singing in an empty parking lot—there is a dandelion&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;gathering his friends. I practice driving through&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the same cracked road you first showed me. I practice&lt;br&gt;&#xA;circling the roundabout and I keep&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;back to the building from three years ago&lt;br&gt;&#xA;sneaking in to the rhythm of the concierge’s nods.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I keep finding myself in places I know too well,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;an overexposed photo of blurred bodies yet&lt;br&gt;&#xA;my face sits clearly where it has always been&lt;br&gt;&#xA;near new students that have learned to carry&lt;br&gt;&#xA;their name tags in their mouths. the pink touch-me-nots&lt;br&gt;&#xA;beg to be saved from the coming winter so I pluck&lt;br&gt;&#xA;one to dry with heavy words and strangers&lt;br&gt;&#xA;identify her as patience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://axguo.github.io/images/posts/swiss_mountain.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;view of the swiss mountains&#34; style=&#34;width: 60%;&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/div&gt; &#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love the mountains here because there are always dense collections of wildflowers under the tree line: purple buds sitting in crevices and yellow petals caressing their grassy neighbors. In places their beauty rivals the alps, the colorful fields an undeniable testimony to the power of nature undisturbed and to the charm of small wonders. They sway in the wind with a carefree attitude of the unbothered and unnamed, some immortalized and dried out by the sun. A few are now resting pressed in my notebook. I try to search for their names. I can’t find any—in another life, one not so forgiving, they would have been known as weeds. White puffballs are the most abundant amongst these mountainside stems, holding globes of dandelion seeds resting half undressed. Dandelions were once celebrated in magic and medicine. Now they’re relentlessly eradicated from lawns and city grass.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>what if writing was...</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-map&#34;&gt;a map &lt;a href=&#34;#a-map&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin with intentions is terribly important — by setting intentions for my writing, I see myself as marking the landscapes and the boundaries of the territory that I am embarking into. To set my intentions is to attempt to create the map of my mind as I know it now — undoubtedly incomplete and fated to be rearranged and re-rearranged, but it will be a starting point because no one begins with a blank map. We all have copied bits and pieces from others, imitating and making up geographies from everyone we have ever met or read. The making of my map consists of conversations under late night kitchen lights describing the contours of a road that resembles friendship and opinions passed around through so many mouths that I wonder if the shape of the conclusion I have received on some political matter that I know nothing about even resembles the original. It feels like playing a long game of picture telephone, passing pieces of drawings around to be mimicked where the entire world is participating and the end result is something horrifically, comically inaccurate and distorted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;an irrational ratio&lt;br&gt;&#xA;each hour spent at the park&lt;br&gt;&#xA;parked outside the bookstore that&lt;br&gt;&#xA;we never entered, spend an hour&lt;br&gt;&#xA;on the phone, conveying a&lt;br&gt;&#xA;secondhand kind of love to my&lt;br&gt;&#xA;friend who hasn’t heard this&lt;br&gt;&#xA;smile in my voice, it’s been so long&lt;br&gt;&#xA;no body should ever be that warm&lt;br&gt;&#xA;i might burn from the flutter of my legs&lt;br&gt;&#xA;doing a silly dance, the audience gone&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the performance is over but you are still here&lt;br&gt;&#xA;making a fool out of my unavailability&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and i bow into a hug that doesn’t quite fit&lt;br&gt;&#xA;yet fingers creep in the grass, faster than&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the recognition of comfort and seeing myself&lt;br&gt;&#xA;in your eyes, a little too close&lt;br&gt;&#xA;a little too familiar&lt;br&gt;&#xA;i’m so used to you, it’s been so long&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I trust my head. Twisted&lt;br&gt;&#xA;vines creep to an unreachable&lt;br&gt;&#xA;sun but knowledge sits in roots&lt;br&gt;&#xA;tangled, knotted in biased hugs.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Amber words dissolve in a salty&lt;br&gt;&#xA;river where flames steal my bark&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and flesh. I swing between birds,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;or are they stationary fish? See&lt;br&gt;&#xA;my body lost in glass ferns,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;too fragile to free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I trust my heart. Violent&lt;br&gt;&#xA;spirits shake yellow chrysanthemums&lt;br&gt;&#xA;growing from my chest. Soft painted&lt;br&gt;&#xA;jealousy flirts with earnest rage. I bow&lt;br&gt;&#xA;to reason without a compass — east&lt;br&gt;&#xA;knows no submission. I try to lose&lt;br&gt;&#xA;myself in hopeless desire&lt;br&gt;&#xA;already lost in autumn showers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>conversations in the dark</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://axguo.github.io/images/posts/nico.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;painting of a colorful city of lights on a hill at night&#34; style=&#34;width: 49%;&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;img-caption&#34; style=&#34;width: 49%;&#34;&gt;Mi Pequeno San Juan by Nico Thomassin: I first saw this painting in a gallery in Puerto Rico and it forever will capture my feeling of awe to witness a whole city glow at night&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt; &#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m laughing and cradling my knees while the moon rises over a sun that has not yet said goodbye. It is an impossibly charming outlook of the entire city of Zürich from this rooftop that somehow is just taller than its neighbors but I still find myself looking forward to the ample clouds that pass by to cover the roundness of the moonlight. Because in the dark, I stop caring about most things. I can feel my face relax, free to move into configurations that no one will see, unburdened by the weight of a smile that always lasts too long. My body reacts in ways unchecked with loose chuckles and shifts of surprise. No one can see me, or so I’d like to believe. What exists in the dark is only the floating voices and a heightened perception of how I feel, and in this moment I am happy. Happy to feel so comfortable sitting around cold pizza with new friends on top of a whole city and happy that silent pauses feel less heavy in the dark. I could close my eyes and hear the exclamations around me and pick out each unique laugh. The absence of light is a blessing for someone who sometimes overthinks, attuned to the minuscule shifts in another’s demeanor. It’s no wonder that some of my favorite conversations have happened at night: lying on the pier under the stars and spilling out our heartaches, jokes on a dark park bench, or conversations like this, where daylight faded and we decided to stay. I think it’s the same reason why I prefer phone calls to video chat: when everything else is stripped away except voice, we fill up the space in a raw, unfiltered way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>things that are slow and sticky</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Memory&amp;rsquo;s images, once they are fixed in words, are erased&amp;quot; - Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;i&#34;&gt;I. &lt;a href=&#34;#i&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6 parts titanium white, 3 parts phthalo blue, 1 part ultramarine blue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;a hint of napthol red and ochre yellow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;a sky that bleeds saying goodbye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;to a sun too quickly burning away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Walnuts can break a man, or at least they broke me. What other nut can be sold encased in an indestructible shell, cutting the hands of an eight year old determined to prove her strength? What need does a bitter and oily nut have to be so guarded, only to be spat and not swallowed by a girl determined to memorize the folds that make it distinct from a pecan so that she may learn who to avoid. In a steady machine, the outer hull is rotated while slashed until metal bristles rub off the first layer, before moving to cracking the shells. A naked walnut can be sold as is, or pressed and crushed and pressed again into a paste. An oil is then freed. The startling flavor created from a violent process makes it perfect for drizzling over salads or complimenting desserts. The pale richness also makes it a prime candidate for a medium to smooth out oil paints.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Dine Alone</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You try to catch the waiter’s attention, but his focus skips over to the young couple by the window. They have just sat down, but there is twice the body to catch the eye — twice the hunger, twice the urgency. You give a small wave as he passes by, not enough for a friend, barely enough for the stranger. There is no need to be extravagant, no one is watching — movement from a still corner will always elicit surprise. There is not much room for back and forth, dishes are not to be shared. No commitment issues, the item you choose is what you’ll get. It all happens very fast -  silent conversations always pass the quickest. You are decisive, you have decided to be a party of one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;unfinished first draft to be workshopped [VERY ROUGH :&amp;rsquo;)]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a mythical beast that few have seen. It is dreamy and beguiling and offers promises of dreams come true. Some have claimed to reap the benefits of its powers, others deny its existence. What is clear is that recently sightings have been low -  it seems to have disappeared, if it ever even existed. Many have hunted and still continue to hunt for this elusive creature in hopes of gaining its secrets: the fabled formula for work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;january 2022 - february 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think about this quote (outside of any context) a lot&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Have you, dear reader, ever tried writing poetry that will set the collective soul of your nation on fire? If no, why not?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3-1-22&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Lately it’s been hard to think - running from city to city and studio to classroom - I’m forgetting to feel the snow crunch beneath my feet and to take my mask off to smell the fresh air. I traveled to LA and spent a week in the woods near Yosemite before being whisked straight into my last undergraduate semester. The peace I found amongst the trees was hard to keep back in the city but the difference I found this time is most of what I am doing brings me great joy - I never thought I’d have to protect my time from myself, to make sure to take breaks from the activities I love to sit with myself and reflect. What has helped is disrupting my routine with reading, and surprisingly writing: something I said I would do for all of 2021 without forming a single sentence, a goal now manifested in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>on daily generation and planting seeds</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a reflection on a month-ish of daily-ish sketches and the seeds that they nourished -&#xA;check them out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aliciaguo.com/daily-sketch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; 🤗&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://axguo.github.io/images/posts/site1.png&#34; alt=&#34;sketches on website&#34; style=&#34;width: 49%;&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://axguo.github.io/images/posts/site2.png&#34; alt=&#34;sketches on website&#34; style=&#34;width: 49%;&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://axguo.github.io/images/posts/site4.png&#34; alt=&#34;sketches on website&#34; style=&#34;width: 49%;&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://axguo.github.io/images/posts/site3.png&#34; alt=&#34;sketches on website&#34; style=&#34;width: 49%;&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On what it means to continue creating art&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;it means leaving some loose thread, some unresolved issue, to carry forward and explore in the next piece&amp;hellip;it means always carrying within you the seed crystal for your next destination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-seed&#34;&gt;The First Seed &lt;a href=&#34;#the-first-seed&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometime around October, I participated with some friends in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/artsatmit/sets/72157720043991878/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;coding cypher&lt;/a&gt; as part of  a collaboration between MIT and Lupe Fiasco where we had the creative freedom to create pretty much anything artistic from a very vague prompt. &amp;ldquo;Cyphers flow freely between diverse performers who improvise their words, sounds, or movements to create a complex matrix of sharing,&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and our piece was an ambiguous improvised mixture of generative art, AI, and rapping. The paper-plate title lovingly and roastingly bestowed upon us was &amp;ldquo;most ambitious&amp;rdquo; (with ambitions not reached). I felt a little disappointed by my inability to realize my mind&amp;rsquo;s fantastical blueprints with code, believing that I would be able to generate the art I envisioned. I labeled myself as a generative artist, but created very little. The question I asked then and still am asking myself: what would my life be like if I acted like I cared about the things I said I did? As an exercise partially aimed at becoming better at manipulating creative code and partially just to prove to myself that I can keep up with an art habit, I challenged myself to do daily generative sketches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>what is art but a hope and a question?</title>
      <link>https://axguo.github.io/posts/art/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a loose weaving of thoughts on (my) art and where I find myself in the creative ecosystem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When asking myself why I create art, an incomplete but true answer would be because it’s what I’ve always done. In the moments that I am incapable of stringing together the right words, I turn to art. It’s how I find myself dealing with feelings - both those that I don’t want and those that I would like to preserve and hold close to take with me wherever I go. It’s a deeply personal act, whether or not that is my intention. I believe that is because it is impossible to hide from your creations, that everything ends up on display and it is entirely you, right now, in the present. What is reflected is who I am, not who I was or who I wish to be. She is the person with whom I engage and spend my time with. I can no more produce the same pieces as I did a year ago than I can create something that I’m not ready to make.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>entering a liminal space</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;december 2021 - january 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;take note of the things that touch your heart, then you will know what you like&amp;rdquo; - Blue Period&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1-21-22&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I’m sitting on a plane to LA - in a liminal space within a larger liminal time. On the precipice of a new destination, but not quite there yet. Traveling. Questioning. The past two months were ones of reflection and searching for the things that touch my heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
