      <description>were not meant to be. I wish
to be lucky, enough
for the red I am wearing.
To be formless, genreless. Miscellaneous
always. To be willingly
categorized. I give you consent.
To be occasionally refreshing.
To be a factory of permissions.
To be a stronger vessel for my heart.
To be next.</description>

      <title>reflections from a month(ish) of generative sketches</title>

      <description>Check out the sketches :)
Some thoughts on a month(ish) of generative sketches. I hesitate to use the word “generative” anymore because it’s been so overtaken by AI. What I mean here for my works are good old creative coding sketches, turtle graphics vibes and shaders. Pixels that have been handcrafted with care.   Pretty informal compared to my post last year and more of a collection of floating thoughts varying in importance to see if the challenge is worth doing again next year and in what capacity.</description>

      <title>Thoughts from a dying mall</title>

      <description>Wake up today feeling the vulnerability of winter. Fall leaves falling, leaving me exposed like every year before. Cold air rushing in the change of seasons and time running out, running towards an arbitrary new year, running towards made up deadlines. The ground becomes too stiff to bury old pictures, so I hang onto them in pockets that won’t fit more than half a person. I see my wishes being stripped naked like the orange trees that line the streets in a direction picked with a roll of the dice.</description>

      <description>Crawling earthquakes are born of a thousand
whispered truths. Picking out crimson apricots,
bruising soft stones with my thumb.
Walking down stiff concrete streets
peeking around corners, wondering if a impish wind
has curved my words. If anyone can hear a daring
breath, humming lyrics never to be shared. I practice
singing in an empty parking lot—there is a dandelion
gathering his friends. I practice driving through
the same cracked road you first showed me.</description>

      <description>back to the building from three years ago
sneaking in to the rhythm of the concierge’s nods.
I keep finding myself in places I know too well,
an overexposed photo of blurred bodies yet
my face sits clearly where it has always been
near new students that have learned to carry
their name tags in their mouths. the pink touch-me-nots
beg to be saved from the coming winter so I pluck</description>

      <description>I love the mountains here because there are always dense collections of wildflowers under the tree line: purple buds sitting in crevices and yellow petals caressing their grassy neighbors. In places their beauty rivals the alps, the colorful fields an undeniable testimony to the power of nature undisturbed and to the charm of small wonders. They sway in the wind with a carefree attitude of the unbothered and unnamed, some immortalized and dried out by the sun.</description>

      <description>a map To begin with intentions is terribly important — by setting intentions for my writing, I see myself as marking the landscapes and the boundaries of the territory that I am embarking into. To set my intentions is to attempt to create the map of my mind as I know it now — undoubtedly incomplete and fated to be rearranged and re-rearranged, but it will be a starting point because no one begins with a blank map.</description>

      <description>an irrational ratio
each hour spent at the park
parked outside the bookstore that
we never entered, spend an hour
on the phone, conveying a
secondhand kind of love to my
friend who hasn’t heard this
smile in my voice, it’s been so long
no body should ever be that warm
i might burn from the flutter of my legs
doing a silly dance, the audience gone
the performance is over but you are still here</description>

      <description>If I trust my head. Twisted
vines creep to an unreachable
sun but knowledge sits in roots
tangled, knotted in biased hugs.
Amber words dissolve in a salty
river where flames steal my bark
and flesh. I swing between birds,
or are they stationary fish? See
my body lost in glass ferns,
too fragile to free.
If I trust my heart. Violent
spirits shake yellow chrysanthemums
growing from my chest. Soft painted</description>

      <description>Mi Pequeno San Juan by Nico Thomassin: I first saw this painting in a gallery in Puerto Rico and it forever will capture my feeling of awe to witness a whole city glow at night  I’m laughing and cradling my knees while the moon rises over a sun that has not yet said goodbye. It is an impossibly charming outlook of the entire city of Zürich from this rooftop that somehow is just taller than its neighbors but I still find myself looking forward to the ample clouds that pass by to cover the roundness of the moonlight.</description>

      <description>“Memory&amp;rsquo;s images, once they are fixed in words, are erased&amp;quot; - Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities
 I. 6 parts titanium white, 3 parts phthalo blue, 1 part ultramarine blue
a hint of napthol red and ochre yellow
a sky that bleeds saying goodbye
to a sun too quickly burning away
Walnuts can break a man, or at least they broke me. What other nut can be sold encased in an indestructible shell, cutting the hands of an eight year old determined to prove her strength?</description>

      <description>You try to catch the waiter’s attention, but his focus skips over to the young couple by the window. They have just sat down, but there is twice the body to catch the eye — twice the hunger, twice the urgency. You give a small wave as he passes by, not enough for a friend, barely enough for the stranger. There is no need to be extravagant, no one is watching — movement from a still corner will always elicit surprise.</description>

1: a branch of morphology that deals with the structure of organisms how to build a home
of identical red scaled roofs —
homeowner’s serpent
swallowing sounds
of mismatched bricks and cartoon walls covering
jelly beans spread on a child’s lap
how does she sort out the saccharine pebbles?

my blood swirls gold and green with</description>

      <description>unfinished first draft to be workshopped [VERY ROUGH :&#39;)]
There&amp;rsquo;s a mythical beast that few have seen. It is dreamy and beguiling and offers promises of dreams come true. Some have claimed to reap the benefits of its powers, others deny its existence. What is clear is that recently sightings have been low - it seems to have disappeared, if it ever even existed. Many have hunted and still continue to hunt for this elusive creature in hopes of gaining its secrets: the fabled formula for work-life balance.</description>

chasing charred duck drowning in soy
click slide push slide slide the now flightless fowl
nested on a bed of scallion evades my
American grip with an uncomfortable liveliness
click squeeze slide push stab nothing like
the the delicate caress of my parent’s movements
swish glide pinch rub stir their chopsticks
a charming dance - I’m convinced they can do anything while
I give up and stab an already dead bird</description>

      <description>january 2022 - february 2022
I think about this quote (outside of any context) a lot1.
 “Have you, dear reader, ever tried writing poetry that will set the collective soul of your nation on fire? If no, why not?”

Lately it’s been hard to think - running from city to city and studio to classroom - I’m forgetting to feel the snow crunch beneath my feet and to take my mask off to smell the fresh air.</description>

      <title>on daily generation and planting seeds</title>

      <description>a reflection on a month-ish of daily-ish sketches and the seeds that they nourished - check them out here 🤗
    On what it means to continue creating art1:
 &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;it means leaving some loose thread, some unresolved issue, to carry forward and explore in the next piece&amp;hellip;it means always carrying within you the seed crystal for your next destination.&amp;rdquo;
  The First Seed Sometime around October, I participated with some friends in a coding cypher as part of a collaboration between MIT and Lupe Fiasco where we had the creative freedom to create pretty much anything artistic from a very vague prompt.</description>

      <description>a loose weaving of thoughts on (my) art and where I find myself in the creative ecosystem
When asking myself why I create art, an incomplete but true answer would be because it’s what I’ve always done. In the moments that I am incapable of stringing together the right words, I turn to art. It’s how I find myself dealing with feelings - both those that I don’t want and those that I would like to preserve and hold close to take with me wherever I go.</description>

      <description>december 2021 - january 2022
 &amp;ldquo;take note of the things that touch your heart, then you will know what you like&amp;rdquo; - Blue Period
 1-21-22
I’m sitting on a plane to LA - in a liminal space within a larger liminal time. On the precipice of a new destination, but not quite there yet. Traveling. Questioning. The past two months were ones of reflection and searching for the things that touch my heart.</description>

      <description>my dad&amp;rsquo;s hands gently coax shy dough balls he raised
into imperfect circles they stretch
glutinous strands
reaching to hug
the clockwise stir of my mom&amp;rsquo;s chopsticks
teaching her filling to bond
low-sodium over sister spices of scallion and ginger
massaging oil into a fragmented mix
I introduce wrapper and meat
binding two ancestors with a tender fold and screaming pinch
blood, not water, holds these dumplings
completing their plump embrace</description>
